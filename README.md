# SwiftUIAppleSignIn
This project displays the following:
1. Vertical sizing control of VStack elements to account for varying screen height
2. Sign In With Apple Implementation
3. Effective separation of logic into scalable architecture

If I had more time, I would:
1. Integrate register/login with actual API
2. Refine spacing of Login area to be more responsive to screen height
3. Create login state
4. Address other TODO's as listed in the codebase
