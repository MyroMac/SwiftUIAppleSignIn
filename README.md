# SwiftUIAppleSignIn
This project displays the following:
1. Vertical sizing control of VStack elements to account for varying screen height
2. Sign In With Apple Implementation
3. Effective separation of logic into scalable architecture

If I had more time, I would:
1. Integrate register/login with actual API
2. Refine spacing of Login area to be more responsive to screen height 
3. Decide how to handle landscape mode and implement
4. Create login state
5. Address other TODO's as listed in the codebase
